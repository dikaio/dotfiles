# ZSH Configuration Directory

Place any additional `.zsh` files here to be automatically sourced by `.zshrc`

Example files:
- `aliases.zsh` - Additional aliases
- `functions.zsh` - Custom functions  
- `work.zsh` - Work-specific configuration
- `private.zsh` - Private settings (gitignored)

All `.zsh` files in this directory will be loaded automatically.
